he loved sitting between her brothers on the couch and watching tv .
while it was good that he had so many male role models , she only hoped he had n't inherited too much of his father 's personality .
after megan watched them disappear in the crowd of family and friends waiting in the church alcove , she bypassed everyone by turning right and heading down the hallway .
at the last door on the right , she knocked .
`` it 's me , megan . ''
emma 's best friend , casey , answered the door .
`` well , if it is n't the fairy godmother , '' she mused with a grin .
after megan stepped inside , casey threw her arms around her .
megan had only met her a few times , but it was hard not liking emma 's vivacious and outgoing friend .
casey 's long brown hair was pulled back in a lose knot , and she wore a demure black slip dress and heels .
`` so how 's it going ? ''
megan asked , gazing from noah 's diapered but na**d form to emma .
she was feeding him a bottle while her upper body was draped in a towel .
