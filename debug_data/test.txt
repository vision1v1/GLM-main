`` it looks like you 're taking all the proper precautions-nothing like spit-up on your dress or his . ''
with a nod , emma replied , `` tell me about it .
especially since his gown is so old . ''
megan eyed the lacy baptismal gown hanging on the closet door .
she recognized it from pictures of ankle 's baptism .
he had worn it , and now it was being passed down to his son .
casey snorted .
`` i 'm sure aidan would n't appreciate you alluding to the fact his gown is an antique , thus in turn saying he 's old . ''
emma laughed .
`` no , i 'm sure he would n't .
of course , he 'd probably argue that while the gown might not have held up , he still looks fabulous and much younger than his age . ''
megan smiled .
`` that sounds just like him . ''
she bent over emma to rub one of noah 's hands .
he grabbed her thumb in his fist and held on for dear life .
`` aw , you love your godmother , do n't you noah ? ''
